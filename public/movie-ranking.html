<h1>Milton's Favorite Films</h1>
  <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
  <hr />
    <h3>Denis Villenueve's Dune</h3>
      <P>Both films are masterpieces.</P>
    <h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
      <P>There are so many awe aspiring things about 
        this film: the cinematography, the lighting, 
        the sound design, the philosophy, not knowing 
        whether Deckered is man or replicant, etc.</P>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
      <P>This film nurtured so much curiosity in me. 
        I kept watching it until I had a decent 
        understanding of everything and I keep watching 
        it to this day.</P>
